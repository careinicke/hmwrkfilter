<h1>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could come at the expense of working families </h1>
<p>For states that pass through federal tax rules, the new act could raise taxes for working families with kids</p>

    	<p>When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on Dec. 22, it made sweeping changes to the tax code. One of the changes that it made was to expand the child tax credit to middle class families by doubling the amount of credit per child and raising the income cap on who could qualify for the credit. </p>

    	<p>The expansion was to make up for cuts in other parts of the tax code. The personal exemption, which helped low and middle-class families keep part of their income tax free, was taken away. In states that piggy back off of the federal tax rules, this means that families with children may have to pay more in taxes in 2019, when all of the rules go into effect. </p>

    	<p>States are now put in a concerning position to decide who will pay for tax cuts. They have only a few months to pass legislation on taxes at the state level.  </p>

    	 <p>"It's not as simple as increasing the amount of existing credit, they will have to pass legislation and we don't know what will happen yet," said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at The Urban Institute Tax Policy Center. "States have to figure out what they're going to do." </p>

  		<p>Some states have rushed to put together legislation of their own to amend the tax code and take the burden of tax cuts off of families with children. Idaho, for example, did not have a state-level child tax credit rule until the new tax plan passed. Now it is one of six states in the country that have a state-level child tax credit rule.  </p>

		<p>Other states have rules around the child and dependent care credit, another new part of the tax code that gives refunds to families paying for child care. But that credit mostly helps families with higher incomes - those that can afford to pay for child care.   </p>

 <p>These credits are a very important part of the safety net for low and middle-income families and a main reason that child poverty has declined in the United States since the early 2000s. Many tax policy experts argue that these credits should be expanded even further to help working families. </p>

 <p>"Kids are staying poor even if their families are working," said Ken Taylor, executive director of Kids Forward Wisconsin, a research and advocacy group dedicated to ending child poverty in Wisconsin. He added, "there definitely is not enough aid - and our elected leaders are trying to make it harder and trying to balance the budget on the backs of families and kids."</p>

 <p>Regardless of the changes that each state makes concerning the new tax code, it will be up for review again soon. </p>

<p>"The child tax credit changes expire after 2025, so we will be reviewing what child and family benefits look like because we will have to evaluate if we're going to expand what we have now or go back to what we had a year ago," Maag said.
